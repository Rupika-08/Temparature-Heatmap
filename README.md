Global Temparature HeatMap

📌 Project Overview

This project is a D3.js-based heatmap that visualizes global temperature variations over time using color-coded blocks. The dataset is sourced from FreeCodeCamp and provides monthly temperature anomalies from 1753 to 2015.

The project is built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification and meets all required user stories.

🚀 Features:

✅ Interactive Heatmap – Displays temperature variations with a color gradient
✅ Tooltip Support – Shows exact temperature and variance on hover
✅ X-Axis (Years) – Shows the timeline from 1753 to 2015
✅ Y-Axis (Months) – Displays months in full text format
✅ Legend – Helps interpret temperature differences
✅ Responsive Design – Adapts to different screen sizes
✅ Accessible & User-Friendly – Clear labels and smooth interactions
